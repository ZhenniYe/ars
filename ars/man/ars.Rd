\title{Adapative Rejection Sampling}
\usage{
ars(N, fn, l = -Inf, u = Inf, center = 0, step = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{sample size (number of observations).}

\item{fn}{log-concave function that is proporitional to the sampling density.}

\item{l}{the lower bound of the density function. The default is -Inf.}

\item{u}{the upper bound of the density function. The default is Inf.}

\item{center}{estimated center of function. The default is 0.}

\item{step}{value of bandwidth around center used to find the starting abscissaes. The default is 0.5.}
}
\value{
\code{ars} returns a vector containing sampled values.
}
\description{
`ars` generates random sample from log-concave functions using adapative rejection sampling.
}
\details{
Using the method of adapative rejection sampling, the function generates random numbers from 
the given distribution in the specified sample size N. For more detials, see Gilks and Wild (1992).
}
\examples{
##  Sample from Standard Normal Distribution
ars(N = 10000, fn = dnorm, l = -Inf, u = Inf, center = 0, step = 0.5)


## Sample from Gamma Distribution
gamma_test <- function(x){
k <- dgamma(x, shape = 7.5, scale = 1)
return(k)
}
ars(N = 10000, fn = gamma_test, l = 0.1, u = 20)
